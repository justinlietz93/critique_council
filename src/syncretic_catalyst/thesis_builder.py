Syncretic Catalyst Thesis Builder

This module implements a comprehensive multi-agent research pipeline that:
1. Takes a concept, theory, or hypothesis from the user
2. Employs specialized research agents to comprehensively explore and develop it
3. Scours research papers (including overlooked historical and cutting-edge modern research)
4. Performs validations, mathematical analysis, and logical reasoning
5. Finds supporting evidence and relevant references
6. Produces a final thesis or academic proposal

Similar to the critique system but constructive rather than critical.

## Concept
{results['concept']}

## Research Overview
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the concept using a multi-agent research approach.
The research was conducted on {results['timestamp']} with ID: {research_id}.

## Research Methodology
The research employed a syncretic catalyst approach with specialized research agents:

## Research Papers
This analysis drew from {len(results['papers'])} relevant academic papers retrieved through semantic vector search.
The complete list of papers can be found in `papers_{research_id}.md`.
