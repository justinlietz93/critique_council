Syncretic Catalyst Thesis Builder

This module implements a comprehensive multi-agent research pipeline that:
1. Takes a concept, theory, or hypothesis from the user
2. Employs specialized research agents to comprehensively explore and develop it
3. Scours research papers (including overlooked historical and cutting-edge modern research)
4. Performs validations, mathematical analysis, and logical reasoning
5. Finds supporting evidence and relevant references
6. Produces a final thesis or academic proposal

Similar to the critique system but constructive rather than critical.
