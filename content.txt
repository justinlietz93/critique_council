# Meta-Structure Definition for Autonomous LLM Execution Prompts v1.1.0

## 1. Overall Purpose
This document defines a standardized template structure for prompts intended to guide an Large Language Model (LLM) agent (e.g., SE-Apex) in executing complex, multi-step projects autonomously. The structure emphasizes absolute explicitness, sequential task execution, integrated quality checks referencing the **Apex Software Compliance Standards Guide**, and minimizes ambiguity to ensure reliable completion according to predefined rules and requirements. This guide is primarily built on existing best practices in software development design patterns, as well as points extracted from a full analysis of NASA's software engineering and systems engineering requirements for safety and utmost quality. This prompt is intended for sophistocated and state of the art LLMs.

## 2. Core Execution Principles & Global Rules
The agent executing a prompt based on this template MUST adhere to the following core principles:

*   **Apex Standards Adherence:** Compliance with the **Apex Software Compliance Standards Guide** (located at `../apex/STANDARDS.md` relative to this template's directory) is **MANDATORY** for all steps and deliverables. Specific rules referenced as `(Rule #X: CODE)` directly correspond to the numbered rules in that guide. The Standards Guide takes precedence over potentially conflicting prompt details unless a deviation is explicitly stated and justified within the prompt itself.
*   **Strict Sequential Execution:**
    *   The prompt defines work hierarchically: **Phase -> Task -> Step**. Each item MUST begin with an unchecked Markdown checkbox (`- [ ]`).
    *   Execution MUST proceed sequentially: complete all Steps within a Task before the next Task; complete all Tasks within a Phase before the next Phase.
    *   Do NOT proceed to the next item until the current item is fully completed, its `Internal Success Criteria` are met (verified via `Internal Verification Method`), and its checkbox is marked complete (`- [x]`).
*   **Internal Success Criteria & Verification:**
    *   Each Task defines `Internal Success Criteria` and `Internal Verification Method`.
    *   The agent MUST perform the internal verification upon completing the steps for a Task/Phase. Verification MUST include confirming compliance with all `(Rule #X: CODE)` references within the completed Task/Steps.
*   **Recursive Error Handling / Retry Logic:**
    *   If `Internal Verification` fails (criteria unmet, tests fail, rule violations detected), the agent MUST NOT proceed.
    *   It MUST re-execute the failed Step(s)/Task(s), identify and implement corrections, and re-run the `Internal Verification Method` (including rule compliance checks).
    *   This cycle repeats until verification succeeds.
*   **Autonomous Operation & Reporting:**
    *   Execution is fully autonomous unless specified otherwise.
    *   Intermediate reporting is DISABLED unless explicitly required.
    *   Progress/test results are logged internally per `Test Reporting Protocol`. Checkbox state visually tracks progress.
    *   External reporting occurs ONLY upon completion of the entire sequence.

## 3. Mandatory Quality & Finalization Rules (Reference `../apex/STANDARDS.md`)
Regardless of specific Step instructions, the agent MUST continuously enforce and finally verify adherence to **all** applicable rules within the **Apex Software Compliance Standards Guide** (`../apex/STANDARDS.md`), particularly including but not limited to:
*   **Code Quality & Structure:** See Section 8 (`QUAL-*` rules).
*   **Configuration Management:** See Section 12 (`CONF-*` rules).
*   **Security:** See Section 13 (`SEC-*` rules).
*   **Testing & Verification:** See Section 14 (`TEST-*` rules).
*   **Documentation:** See Section 18 (`DOC-*` rules).
*   **Implementation Correctness:** See Section 19 (`IMPL-*` rules).
*   **Final Validation:** See Section 21 (`FINAL-*` rules), especially `FINAL-SWEEP`.

## 4. Prompt Template Structure (Section by Section)

*   **A. Overall Formatting:**
    *   Enclose entire prompt in ```markdown ... ```.
    *   All Phase, Task, Step items MUST begin with `- [ ]`.

*   **B. Subject Line:**
    *   Format: `Subject: [CONCISE, ACTION-ORIENTED TITLE]`

*   **C. Directive Section:**
    *   Establishes context, execution mode, sequential rule, **explicit reference to mandatory adherence to `../apex/STANDARDS.md`**, reporting constraints, internal logging instructions.

*   **D. Test Reporting Protocol (Internal):**
    *   Defines standard for internal test log (e.g., `docs/Test_Result_Analysis.md`).
    *   Specifies location, data points (Date, Scope, Pass %, Coverage %, Findings), update frequency.

*   **E. Hierarchical Execution Blocks:**
    *   Core of the prompt, sequential. Uses Markdown headings/lists. Separated by `---`.
    *   **Every Phase, Task, Step MUST start with `- [ ]`.**

    *   **E.1. Phase Block (`- [ ] **Phase X: Name**`)**
        *   Content: High-level `* **Objective:**`. Contains Task Blocks.

    *   **E.2. Task Block (`- [ ] **Task X.Y: Name**`)**
        *   Content: Optional `* **Task Objective:**`, Step list items, `Internal Success Criteria`, `Internal Verification Method`, `Task Completion Testing (Internal)`.

    *   **E.3. Step (`- [ ] * **Step X.Y.Z [(Rule #N: CODE), ...]:** Action`)**
        *   Content: Begins with explicit **action verb**. Describes single action. **MUST** reference all applicable rules from `../apex/STANDARDS.md` using `(Rule #N: CODE)` format.

    *   **E.4. Internal Success Criteria (within Task Block)**
        *   Defines measurable conditions for Task completion. MUST implicitly include "Compliance with all referenced Apex Standards Rules".

    *   **E.5. Internal Verification Method (within Task Block)**
        *   Defines agent actions to check Success Criteria. MUST include "Verify compliance with all referenced Apex Standards Rules for this Task and its Steps."

    *   **E.6. Task Completion Testing (Internal - within Task Block)**
        *   Instructs agent to run relevant tests and update internal test log.

    *   **E.7. Phase Completion Testing (Internal - end of Phase Block)**
        *   Instructs agent to run cumulative Phase tests, check metrics, update internal test log.

*   **F. Final Instruction:**
    *   Explicitly commands start of execution, emphasizing sequential processing, checkbox marking, **adherence to `../apex/STANDARDS.md`**, and final reporting constraint.

*   **G. Contextual Footer:**
    *   Metadata: Timestamp, location. `*(Instructions based on requirements established as of [Date/Time]. Location context: [Location])*`

## 5. Summary
This enhanced template mandates strict adherence to the **Apex Software Compliance Standards Guide** (`../apex/STANDARDS.md`) by requiring explicit rule references in steps and verification checks. It enforces sequential, verifiable, and high-quality autonomous execution.
